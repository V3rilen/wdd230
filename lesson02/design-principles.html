          In this example they make the most important information the largest,
          which in this case is the maintenance requests. The next biggest
          element is the buttons, which the user is likely to use a lot on the
          page. And finally the smallest elements are the navigation tabs that
          many user wont use.

      <section class="card">
        <header>White Space and Clean Design</header>
        <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>
        <span>Google</span>
        <img alt="Screenshot of Googles home page" src="./images/google.jpg" />
        <p>
          In this example Google uses whitespace to draw the users attention to
          the most important element on the page, the search bar. Followed by
          other smaller and spaced out elements such as the tab count at the
          top-right, quick navigation links below the search bar, and news at
          the very bottom.

        <p>
          In this final example, the website uses repatition to help the user
          see their product in many ways. They start out by saying what they
          have to offer, and providing a CTA to request a demo, then they
          provide many visuals to show the user what their product looks like
          and what it can do, and finally they have some reviews to highlight
          the customer appreciation of the product.
